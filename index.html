      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome to my page! I am Barbara. I am a former educator, who taught a mixed curriculum of computer science, astronomy, mathematics, statistics, and physics. I fell in love with web development, and decided to pursue it as a career path recently. I am very excited about the opportunities and challenges presented by web development in particular, and enjoy the various natures of the problems faced. I've taught a basic introduction to web development for years, and look forward to learning new technologies like React and Node.js while refining the skills I already have.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Seattle, Washington</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am an avid LARPer, and thoroughly enjoy my work with various LARPs in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job isn't a job so much as a series of facets. I love people and do all my best work in conjunction with others, whether that's talking through challenging bits of code, asking or answering questions, planning features, or just sitting together with others while we work on different things. People motivate me.</p>
      <p>I also love to work on challenging projects. Answering questions and making people feel good about solutions gives me great joy. I am looking for work where complex problem-solving is a must, and those problems are focused on challenges people face in their daily lives.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is something that has struck me for years as being a great career path. Between my love of problem-solving and my love of people, it just seems like a natural place to be. Web development is people-centric - offering detailed solutions to challenges people face on a daily basis - and demands high levels of solution-oriented thinking. I am here to learn how to be that solution-oriented thinker and incorporate the answers I know are achievable with those that are cutting-edge, and will help people live better lives.</p>
